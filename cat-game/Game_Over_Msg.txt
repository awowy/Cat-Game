Watch your paws next time. 
Practice makes perfect.
How 'bout we learn how to improve our leap in the playground? 
Guess we'll be sleeping outside tonight... with a bandage on.
Don't worry, it's just a tad bit of scratch. 
The higher the hop, the higher the risk.
At least I still have the bucks.
It... hurts...
Cats have 9 lives... But we don't even remember how many lives we have left.
Out of every floor, why did my owner choose the top... 
Looks like we ain't running errands tomorrow.
